# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#event = Event.order(:created_at).take(1)
#1.times do
#  event.each { |event|
#    event.violation.create!(
#      lat: 32.2460,
#      lng: -110.9595,
#      address: '123 Seed St',
